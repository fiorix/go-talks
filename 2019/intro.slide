Hello world
An introduction to the Go programming language (v2)

* Overview

* Background

- Created in 2007 by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson and Robert Griesemer
- Concurrency based on Tony Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)
- Statically compiled, object-oriented*, garbage collected
- Goroutines and channels for concurrency
- Channels as first class objects

Go provide interfaces for composition, but has no type hierarchy.

* Why another language?

- Small, simple and clean
- Created for modern multi-processor architectures
- Easy to read and write top to bottom, statically typed
- Builds fast, makes deployment trivial (cross compiled static binary)
- Optimized for developer efficiency at the cost of a runtime

Go compilers are based on the Plan 9 tool chain.

* Keep in mind

- Go has a runtime (M, P, G)
- Things block; no callback hell
- Strong type system
- Powerful I/O system
- Amazing tools, and Gophers!

* Packages, variables and data structures

- Code is organized in packages
- Packages have absolute import paths
- Exported vs non-exported (analogous to public vs private)
- As simple as it gets: capitalized is exported
- Go suggests the use of CamelCase, not underlines
- Exported names *must* be documented

* Types and interfaces

- You can create any custom type
- Any type can have functions associated
- Types are initialized with a default value
- Interfaces provide great type abstraction
- The io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces

Package documentation:

.link http://golang.org/pkg/io/

* Hello world

.play intro/hello.go

You cannot import packages or declare variables that you don't use.

Package documentation:

.link http://golang.org/pkg/fmt/

* Programming environment

- The `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` environment variables

Quick setup:

	export GOROOT=$HOME/go
	export GOPATH=$HOME/gocode

	export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin

	curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.12.6.darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar -zx -C $HOME

All code goes under the `$GOPATH/src` directory.

* Concurrency

* Goroutines and Channels

Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.

.play intro/concurrency1.go /START/,/STOP/

.link http://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide Go Concurrency Patterns

* The select statement

A control structure unique to concurrency that provides another way to handle
multiple channels. It's like a switch, but each case is a communication.

.play intro/concurrency2.go /START/,/STOP/

* Chinese whisperes, gopher style

* Daisy-chain

.play intro/daisy.go /func/,$

Source:

.link http://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide#39

* Important to remember

- Any function can be a goroutine
- Goroutines are lightweight threads
- Channels can be of any type
- The `select` statement can handle multiple channels
- The `range` statement (in a `for` loop) can read indefintely from a channel
- Channels of type `struct{}` are optimized
- Closing a channel can be used as a signal to the end of an operation
- Goroutines and channels can be used to implement lock-free algorithms

* Code snippets

* Interfaces

.play intro/interface.go /START/,/STOP/

* For loops on slices

.play intro/forslice.go /^func main/,/^$/

* For loops on maps

.play intro/formap.go /^func main/,/^$/

* Labels

You can `break` to a specific label. The `continue` statement also accepts a
label, but only applies to loops.

.play intro/label.go /func main/,/^$/

* HTTP server

.play intro/httpserver.go /START/,/STOP/

- When TLS is enabled, HTTP/2 is also enabled automatically

Package documentation:

.link http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/

* HTTP client

.code intro/httpserver_test.go /START2/,/STOP2/

Notes:

- Functions can have multiple return values
- The `defer` statement

* Testing web servers

.code intro/httpserver_test.go /START1/,/STOP1/

* XML and JSON

- Marshal and unmarshal to and from structs
- Structs can have tags associated for data transformation

Package documentation and examples:

.link http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/
.link http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/

* Consuming JSON from freegeoip.net (1/2)

This exercise shows how to consume JSON data from freegeoip.net.

Sample:

	$ curl -s freegeoip.net/json/github.com | python -m json.tool
	{
		"city": "San Francisco",
		"country_code": "US",
		"country_name": "United States",
		"ip": "192.30.252.131",
		"latitude": 37.77,
		"longitude": -122.394,
		"metro_code": 807,
		"region_code": "CA",
		"region_name": "California",
		"time_zone": "America/Los_Angeles",
		"zip_code": "94107"
	}

* Consuming JSON from freegeoip.net (2/2)

.play intro/freegeoip.go /START/,/STOP/

* C and Go

The alternative `gccgo` compiler allows use of C code in Go.

.code intro/cgoexample.go /START/,/STOP/

Package documentation:

.link http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/

* Cross compilation

The Go compilers offer native support for cross compilation due to their
architecture.

Cross compile using `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables.

.link https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment Supported platforms

.link https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GccgoCrossCompilation gccgo cross compilation

Examples:

	GOOS=linux   GOARCH=amd64 go build
	GOOS=freebsd GOARCH=amd64 go build
	GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build

* The "go get" tool

- Resolves code dependencies for you
- Downloads and build packages automatically using `git`, `svn`, `mercurial`...

Download the presentation tool and this presentation:

	go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
	go get github.com/fiorix/go-talks

Example of downloading build dependencies:

	go get github.com/fiorix/freegeoip
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fiorix/freegeoip/cmd/freegeoip
	go get -v
	go build

* Profiling

The standard library provides run time profiling data in the format expected
by the `pprof` visualization tool.

.link http://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/ runtime/pprof

The `net/http` package has a profiler that can serve data over HTTP on demand.
